Some computer scientists without conscience bread you serve with the theft of files with sensitive content.
On black market circulate lists, which are given on the size of the file you specified
server and the prices are subscribers willing to pay for them.
Each capable of villain knows that the penetration of a limited amount of time before it can be traced, in
which can be transferred from the server a limited amount of data. Due to the encryption, in part,
downloaded files are not useful for them and not get a penny. Therefore, it is very important
decide which file to download, as it is dependent on this final earnings. 
A find optimal solution is not so easy.

Write a program that will be the data for a particular server calculate the maximum earnings
which can be achieved by optimal selection of downloaded files. The sum of the sizes
downloaded files must not exceed the specified limits.

The data will be in the first line containing a positive integer that represents the restriction
the total size of data transferred (1 ≤ V ≤ 10 ^ 9).
This will be followed by 40 lines, each containing two positive integers separated by a space:

vi ci

The first (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10 ^ 9) represents the size of the other (1 ≤ s ≤ 10 ^ 9), the price ite
files.

Program to the standard output the result as well as the newline character ('\ n').

Example:

Input:

2014
500 36
1000 100
16 8
500 42
1024 120
10 2

Output:

180
